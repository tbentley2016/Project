Objectives
add info here

This GitHub repository contains:
 - The file titled "Using_Machine_Learning_To_Predict_Stroke.ipynb" is a Jupyter Notebook using Python code. This contains all code used to upload the data, clean the data, eploratory data analysis, create and evaluate models. Additionally, there are interactive features within the code, allowing for users to click buttons to display different charts or information. 

 - The file titled "healthcare-dataset-stroke-data.csv" contains all the Stroke data used during this project. This dataset was provided by Kaggle by Fedesoriano. 

 - The file titled "requirements.txt" lists all the required Python packages necessary to run the Jupyter Notebook file. 

These files together allow for MyBinder to create a publiclly accessable, interactive website which only shows the output of the code: https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/tbentley2016/Project/HEAD?urlpath=%2Fvoila%2Frender%2FUsing_Machine_Learning_To_Predict_Stroke.ipynb
